## Your Rights

This Plugin is distributed with GNU AGPL 3.0 license. You may refer to the license to find out which rights are entitled to you.

## Our Liability

This Plugin is distributed with GNU AGPL 3.0 license. You may refer to the license to learn which liabilities are exempted for the developers of this software, including Dimension and various contributors.

## Privacy Policy

This Plugin collects your sending history and receiving history as data records, with certain metadata (SNS username, SNS nickname, Persona name, the URL of the Post where a red packet is first found). These data records will only remain in your local database and will not be transferred over networks, unless you explicitly choose to do so in Maskbook database features (cross-device database synchronization, etc).

However, this Plugin is a networking utility software, therefore it communicates with various third parties over networks; this is similar to how web browsers communicate with websites. These third parties include (without limitation to) Ethereum block producers and any CDN service they might employ. These third parties may collect your IP address and your browser user agent string.
