Mask Network Plugin "Web3 File Service"

Privacy Policy for Uploader

Last Updated on Dec 09, 2022

Coverage

This privacy policy document is written for uploaders, namely those who upload files in Mask Network plugin "File Service", a non-essential component of the Mask Network software.

Information Being Collected

Mask File Service is built over blockchain technology provided by our partnered File Storage Protocols, and is designed by the developers of Mask Network.

File Storage Protocols include: Arweave and IPFS.

By uploading a file, the nodes of the File Storage Protocols blockchain network may or may not collect your browser type info, your IP address.

Unless you choose to upload an unencrypted file, the nodes of the File Storage Protocols blockchain network and the developers of Mask Network are not able to know the content of your file.

Certain metadata of your file will be made public, including file name, file size, date of uploading.

The developers of Mask Network maintain a cache service to allow the file to be downloaded before the file is available in the File Storage Protocols blockchain network. The developers of Mask Network are therefore able to collect such metadata and your IP address, but the collected information will only be used for anti-abuse purposes.

You may learn more about the privacy policy of our partnered File Storage Protocols at:

Arweave at [https://arweave.org](https://arweave.org/).

IPFS at[ https://www.ipfs.com/privacy](https://www.ipfs.com/privacy).
