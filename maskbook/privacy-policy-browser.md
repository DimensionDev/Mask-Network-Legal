Last Updated on **Jul 10, 2020**

## Coverage

This privacy policy document covers first-party implementations of Mask Network the Extension Software, which are engineered to work with web browsers, e.g. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox. It does not cover distribution methods (e.g. Google Chrome Web Store), Mask Network website, third-party implementations of Mask Network, or other first-party implementations of Mask Network which are engineered to work in alternative environments (e.g. Apple iOS and Google Android).

## Introduction

The data being collected include: Your social network profile URL, the Mask Network public keys of your contacts (friends, who you follow, and who follow you), the relations between you and your contacts, the cleartext of your posts, the encryption keys of your posts, and the data managed by each Plugin in Mask Network (they have their own privacy policies).

- Your SNS profile metadata, including name, username, avatar, etc.
- Your SNS timeline information, including posts, comments under posts, etc.

## Intermediary Services

Definition: An intermediary service is an online network service which is designed to work with Mask Network software implementations in order to allow Mask Network work properly (or efficiently).

Some information are sent to intermediary services over network, for and only for the fulfillment of functionalities of Mask Network the Extension Software.

- Your Mask Network public key.
- The URL of your SNS profile.
- The URL of your SNS account ownership proof post.
- Un-anonymized recipient-specific asymmetric ciphers (ECDH) which encrypt the post-encryption keys (AES). (Until v1.6.0)
- Anonymized recipient-specific asymmetric ciphers (ECDH) which encrypt the post-encryption keys (AES). (Since v1.6.0)

Mask Network the Extension Software is designed to work with alternative intermediary services. Alternative intermediary services are those intermediary services which are operated by parties other than the developer of Mask Network. Mask Network will discover alternative intermediary services when first-party intermediary services (those intermediary services provided by the developer of Mask Network) are unavailable or unstable. These alternative intermediary services will be able to obtain the same information which are sent to first-party intermediary services, no less, no more.

## Information Being Collected by Alternative Parties

As long as the online services provided by the developers of Mask Network run on PaaS and IaaS cloud-computing platforms and through CDN, services employed by the developer of Mask Network, including Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Engine, Microsoft Azure, CloudFlare, Fastly, GitHub, Akamai, Linode, and Digital Ocean may technically be able to intercept communication and computation of online services provided by the developer of Mask Network which are designed for and only for the fulfillment of the functionalities of Mask Network. Intelligence agencies and law enforcement authorities may also intercept communications. The developer of Mask Network assume no liability in such cases of infringement.
